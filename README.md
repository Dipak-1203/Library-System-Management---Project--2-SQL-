ðŸ“š Library System Management â€“ Project 2 (PostgreSQL)
ðŸ“– About the Project

This project is a Library Management System built using PostgreSQL.
I started with a raw dataset, cleaned it, and then created a complete database with multiple tables connected through relationships.
The goal of this project was to practice SQL in a real-world way â€” including CRUD operations, joins, group functions, stored procedures, and solving company-level queries.

ðŸ›  Steps I Followed

Created a new database in PostgreSQL

Designed 6 tables:

branch

employees

books

members

issued_status

return_status

Connected all tables using relationships (ERD Diagram)

Inserted data into the tables using INSERT statements

Solved 18 SQL tasks that cover:

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Joins (Inner, Left, Multi-Join)

Aggregate functions (SUM(), COUNT(), AVG())

Group By queries

Stored procedures in PL/pgSQL

Real-world reporting queries (Top books, overdue members, monthly usage, etc.)

ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings

How to design a normalized database from scratch

Writing optimized SQL queries for business use cases

Using joins to connect multiple tables

Building stored procedures for automation (like updating book status after return)

Creating an ERD diagram to understand relationships clearly

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This project helped me understand how databases are designed and used in real companies.
I learned to combine different SQL concepts into a complete solution and answer business-style questions with data.
